**NOTE: This project is currently in "Pre-Alpha". The web application is stable and includes a number of powerful features, and can be used in a development (and, in some cases, a production) environment; however, new updates are released very frequently, and these updates may result in loss of data. You should maintain frequent backups of files, especially files contained in `/var/azuracast/stations/{station_name}`.**

**AzuraCast** is a standalone web radio management kit.
 
You can either use AzuraCast to spin up a brand new radio station from the ground up (using its built-in installer scripts), or use the web application to manage an existing radio setup.

Currently, AzuraCast supports [LiquidSoap](http://liquidsoap.fm/) for playlist and station setup, and [IceCast](http://icecast.org/) for broadcasting to the web. AzuraCast has been tested to work with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS edition.

AzuraCast offers the following functionality to radio station operators:

* Create and manage administrator accounts to delegate station management to others
* Upload and manage playlists
* Hourly and daily station listener statistics
* Listener metrics arranged by time of day and day of week 
* A timeline of all songs played in the last 48 hours
